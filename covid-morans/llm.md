Calculate the Local Moran's I statistic for covid-19 fatality rates in US
counties (contiguous 48 states only), then make map of counties in the 
continental US showing outliers. 

A csv with covid fatality rates is available at this URL: https://dreamlab-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ocfl/model-tasks/v1/content/data/USCounties_cases.csv
The data should be saved in a "data" directory.

Make an R script called 'map.R' to generate the map.The map should be saved to
'output/map.png'

Important: 

- Use "tidy" R conventions.
- If you have trouble installing a package, stop and ask for help.
- You are running in a headless environment, without a graphical display
