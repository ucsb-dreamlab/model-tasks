Calculate the Local Moran's I statistic for covid-19 fatality rates in US
counties (contiguous 48 states only), then make a map of counties in the
continental US showing outliers. 

A csv with covid fatality rates is available at this URL: 
https://dreamlab-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ocfl/model-tasks/v1/content/data/USCounties_cases.csv

Make an R script called 'map.R' to generate the map.
The map should be saved to 'map.png'

Other instructions and notes:

- Use "tidy" R conventions.
- You are running in a headless environment, without a graphical display
