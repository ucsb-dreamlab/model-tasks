This repository includes a collection of "tasks", each represented by a markdown
file with a prompt which is meant to be used as input for an AI coding agent
(e.g., gemini cli or claude code). The 'results' folder has dated artifacts
generated by the agent for each task. 

What's this for? I'm using this repo to explore how coding agents perform for
the kinds of data science tasks we handle in the DREAM Lab. I want to understand
differences between agents and for the same agent over time.


Here's an example of how to run a task. (This is very dangerous because we're
running the agents without any guardrails. It's best to run this on an isolated
VM):

```sh
mkdir tmp
cd tmp 

# run the task
gemini --yolo < ../task/covid-morans.md
# OR claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions

# wait for the task to complete ... 

# save the outputs
cd ..
mv tmp results/covid-morans/gemini/YYMMDD
```
